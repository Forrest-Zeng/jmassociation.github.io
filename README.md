we are the junior musicianship association. and we're here to make a difference in the lives of others through sharing music with the community.



art is a form of creative expression. the way it is portrayed relies almost completely on the artist. through music, comes individuality. you are, in some sense, speaking through your art.



at jma, we combined our individual creativity into a universally appreciated art - the expression of fine music.



join us in this wonderful journey today. your participation will make a difference.
